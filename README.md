# Adventurer-Classes
A Python project that allows the user to create Adventurer instances of varying types, such as a...
- Fighter
- Wizard 
- Thief

This also allows you to simulate fights between these instances as well as simulate tournaments between several Adventurer instances.

After every single duel the following is stored in a SQL database:
- Names of the combatants
- HP's (hit points) of the combatants
- The winner of the duel
- Final difference in HP of the duel
